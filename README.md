The Simon Game, testing your short-term memory:
The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing every button pressed till that round. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
Currently, only HTML, CSS, and JS (jQuery) are used in this project.
