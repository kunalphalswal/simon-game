# simon-game
The Simon Game, testing your short-term memory:
The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires the user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.
Complete instructions are available on the website.
Currently, only HTML, CSS, and JS (jQuery) are used in this project.
