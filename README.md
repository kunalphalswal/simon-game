# simon-game
The Simon Game, testing your short term memory.
The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
For now, only HTML,CSS and JS(jQuery) are used in this project.
